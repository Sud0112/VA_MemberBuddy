### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the business and functional requirements for the ClubPulse AI platform, a sophisticated, AI-powered web application for a premium health and wellness club. The platform serves three key user personas: prospective customers, registered members, and club staff. It integrates generative AI to enhance lead acquisition, improve member engagement and retention, and streamline staff workflows. The primary goal is to provide a seamless, valuable, and modern digital experience that reflects the brand's premium and innovative identity.

### 2. Business Goals & Objectives

*   **Enhance Member Engagement & Retention:** Provide personalized value to members through an AI workout planner and a dynamic loyalty rewards program, thereby reducing churn.
*   **Improve Staff Efficiency:** Equip staff with AI-powered tools to proactively manage at-risk members and create targeted loyalty campaigns, reducing manual effort.
*   **Strengthen Brand Perception:** Position the club as a technology leader in the fitness industry by offering a cutting-edge, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing digital platform.

### 3. Scope of Work
The scope includes a single, integrated web application with three distinct user experiences:
1.  **A Public-Facing Website:** For marketing, information dissemination, and new member acquisition.
2.  **A Secure Member Portal:** An authenticated area for registered members to manage their profile and access exclusive features.
3.  **A Secure Staff Dashboard:** An authenticated area for authorized staff to access member management and marketing tools.
